# Analysis Summary

## Overview of Project

  The purpose of this analysis is to summarize and then contrast the performance of the listed Tickers over the course of a year, as well as displaying the overall return on profit for that stock over the course of that year. This Project was made in a way that so long as the Data entered into the Workbook in the same manner and the same naming conventions followed on the name of individual sheet names it will continue to function moving forward.
  
## Overview of Results

#### 2017
When looking at the results of the 2017 Data it can be seen that overall for the year the stocks selected to be followed for this exercise had an overall positive trend overall. From the information that you provided for the basic creation of the spreadsheet these stocks would seem to be a solid choice of investment with only one TERP showing a neagative return for the year as we see here.

#### 2018

However, when further information is provided and the results for the year of 2018 are also added this story changes.

When we consult the information from the analysis of the 2018 stock ticker history the situation seems to be entirely different. From all of the stocks that were covered as profitable in the previous year only one of them is still profitable in the most recent data set provided. While this stock did increase exponentially in value over the course of the year, the other stock that remained profitable also took a loss from the previous year while the remained all took a sharp decline.

### Conclusions

Without access to further years of information to show any sort of trend to see if there is an ebb and flow to these tickers to determine if the current downturn is a normal part of the stocks price cycle, making it a good time to invest none of these tickers have shown to be educated choices for investment at the time of this analysis.
